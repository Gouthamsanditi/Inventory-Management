# Inventory-Management
Housekeeping inventory refers to the stocks of purchased operating supplies, equipment and other items held for future use in housekeeping operations.
Stock control of all the inventory items needs proper records and supervision by the housekeeping staff to avoid wastages, misuse and damages. Our web page provides such supervision.
Our proposed project is a real time implementation of an inventory control system for housekeeping inventory management by the staff such that they can perform following actions:
 ->Adding the item in the inventory.
 ->Editing the item’s name, price, quantity and image of items entered.
 ->Sorting the inventory by item’s name, price and quantity.
 ->Searching for a specific item in the inventory.
 ->Deleting the item in the inventory.
Repeated entry of the item’s details will not be stored into the database.

HTML deals with the structure and layout of web pages.
CSS to handle the visuals and cosmetics.
Javascript to add dynamic elements to the webpage (used in search and sorting features).
MySQL database to store and retrieve the data.
